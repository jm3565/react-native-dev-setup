## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Setting up a new mobile dev environment for either Windows or Mac often takes some time I'd rather spend coding cool features. This tool will allow you to run scripts that will do all that boring setup for you in a fraction of the time.

This statement from the [React Native official docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) was my inspiration for setting this up:

>  If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes. ***If they are not installed, you should expect to spend about an hour installing and configuring them.***

While doing this once is not as bad, having to do it a second time (for whatever reason) is not ideal

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Right now im going to setup basic scripts for Windows and Mac, Eventually I'll introduce a cli that will make this process a breeze
